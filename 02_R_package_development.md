# R package development

What is an R package? Set of functions which can be loaded as a whole, so you don't have to source them individually.

Much of the R package development is effectively an extension of the structure of an R project. In this context, folders have particular purposes and only a limited number of additional files are required to change a standard R project into an R package.
